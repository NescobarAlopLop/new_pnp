# new_pnp

As the name proclaims its a new and better way of running PNP algorithm. Its everything you have ever dremt of.

Please have a look in the example folder for a comparison between built in OpenCVs PNP and this version.

I had no part in developing the algorith, I have only made it available as a library for easier use in other repositories.
